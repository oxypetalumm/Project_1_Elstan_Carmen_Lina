# Life_expectancy_project

This project uses four data sets from the above source:

1) Life expectancy at birth (in years) 
2) Healthy life expectancy (HALE) at birth (in years) 
3) Population using at least basic drinking water services percentages
4) Population using at least basic sanitation services percentages

We want to find out life expectancy across countries:
- What is the healthy life expectancy?
- Life expectancy between sexes?
- How the best country measures against worst?
- How the numbers changed throughout time?
- How basic drinking water may affect life expectancy?
- How sanitation may affect life expectancy?
- The difference between rural versus urban areas?

This project looks into the life expectancy at birth (in years) of ten countries and the healthy life expectancy (HALE) at birth (in years) along with the population using at least basic drinking water services percentages and population using at least basic sanitation services percentages. 

We picked the ten countries using a google search result to find out the 10 overall best countries and found that the United States was #7. Thus, we used the 7 best countries and selected three from the 10 worst countries. 

Through this project and graphs presented, we are able to analyze how the life expectancy years may be affected with drinking water and sanitation. This is to find out if our hypothesis that drinking water and sanitation does in fact correlate to a healthy life expectancy.

This is also a good reminder of how the basic services in life help us live a better and healthier life compared to those less fortunate and developed countries.
